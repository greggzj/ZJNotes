In Section 5.2, we’ll cover traditional
routing algorithms for computing least cost paths in a graph; these algorithms are the
basis for two widely deployed Internet routing protocols: OSPF and BGP, that we’ll
cover in Sections 5.3 and 5.4, respectively. As we’ll see, OSPF is a routing protocol
that operates within a single ISP’s network. BGP is a routing protocol that serves to
interconnect all of the networks in the Internet; BGP is thus often referred to as the
“glue” that holds the Internet together.

# 5.1 Introduction

Let’s quickly set the context for our study of the network control plane by recalling
Figures 4.2 and 4.3. There, we saw that the 

forwarding table (in the case of
destination-based forwarding) and 

the flow table (in the case of generalized forwarding)
were the principal elements that linked the network layer’s data and control
planes.

We learned that these tables specify the local data-plane forwarding behavior
of a router. We saw that in the case of generalized forwarding, the actions taken (Section
4.4.2) could include not only forwarding a packet to a router’s output port, but
also dropping a packet, replicating a packet, and/or rewriting layer 2, 3 or 4 packetheader
fields.
